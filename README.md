Tech Stack: React Native, Expo, TypeScript, Figma, Firebase (basic), AsyncStorage

LocalLink is a mobile application designed to bridge the gap between rural artisans and farmers and potential customers by providing a direct and accessible platform for product listings, communication, and sales.

The application is built using React Native and TypeScript to ensure cross-platform compatibility and strong type safety. It features a multilingual interface that supports multiple local languages, making it inclusive for non-English-speaking users. Data persistence is handled through AsyncStorage, allowing offline access to key features for users in low-connectivity areas.

For backend functionality, I integrated Firebase to enable user authentication and real-time listing updates. This allows artisans and farmers to post new products and receive immediate visibility to buyers without delays.

The user interface was designed in Figma, optimized for low-literacy users by employing large, easy-to-identify icons, minimal text, and region-specific layout adaptations. This design ensures that even users with limited reading skills can easily navigate the app.

Key Features:

Multilingual UI with intuitive navigation.

Offline-friendly local storage using AsyncStorage.

Real-time updates and authentication via Firebase.

Low-literacy accessibility through icon-first design.
